An interactive news story about the CIA's drone-assassination program. This application allows users to save information about a particular drone strike, view compelling data visualizations about this topic, and read a live Twitter feed about drones (created with Socket.io). It's built on the MEAN stack, uses D3.js and Google Maps to visualize data and three external APIs (New York Times, Twitter and Dronestream) to give users access to a plethora of information. I used Bootstrap for most of the design.
